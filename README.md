# Zero or one?

Welcome to IonQ's QML vision challenge, hosted by SKKU!

In this challenge you'll work like an IonQ Apps Team scientist to explore image classification using quantum machine learning (QML) methods.

## Setup

Get started by cloning this repository, which contains the source code for `ionqvision`, IonQ's next-generation SDK. Fire up your terminal and run the following command!

```
git clone https://github.com/ionq-applications/ionq-vision-challenge.git
```

Then follow our [installation guide](https://willieab.github.io/qml-challenge-scorer/env-setup) to set up your development environment.

## Challenge

Now you're ready to get hacking! Check out the [challenge description](https://willieab.github.io/qml-challenge-scorer/) and use the provided starter code to train your novel models and submit them for training.

The model with the most accurate predictions wins! 🏆

>[!IMPORTANT]
> The `main` branch is read-only, so you'll need to push all your commits to a new branch. This means you can only `BinaryMNISTClassifier.submit_model_for_training` method within your own team's branch.
>
> You can create a new branch using your team name for identification by running the following command at the root level of your cloned repository.
> ```
> git checkout -b my-team-name
> ```

> [!CAUTION]
> Be sure to replace `my-team-name` in the last command with your team's name!
> This step is **critical**. We'll use branch names to identify team submissions, so give your team a unique name!
